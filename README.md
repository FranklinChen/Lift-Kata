Lift Kata
==========

This repo has a starting position for doing the Lift Kata with an Approval testing approach. It includes a printer which can print a lift system using ASCII art. There is only enough of an implementation to support this. Your job is to implement the rest of the software so the lifts can move.

Deciphering the ASCII Art
-------------------------

A this is a sample printout from the lift printer:

	 3    [A]          3
	 2        [B] ]C[  2
	 1 v               1
	 0     *           0

This information may help you to understand it:

- Each line corresponds to a floor. There are four floors numbered 0,1,2,3.
- There are three lifts, named 'A', 'B', 'C'.
- Lift 'C' has the doors open, the other two have their doors closed.
- Lift 'A' has a request for floor 0, which is marked with a *.
- There is a call on floor 1 to go down.


Lift Kata Description
---------------------

Since lifts are everywhere and they contain software, how easy would it be to write a basic one? Letâ€™s TDD a lift, starting with simple behaviors and working toward complex ones. Assume good input from calling code and concentrate on the main flow.

Lift features:

- a lift moves between a number of floors.
- a lift has a display showing the current floor.
- a lift has a panel of buttons passengers can press to request floors.
- a lift responds to calls from other floors. A call has both a floor and a desired direction.
- a lift has doors which may be open or closed.
- a lift can only move between floors if the doors are closed.
- a lift fulfills a request when it moves to the correct floor and opens the doors.
- a lift fulfills a call when it moves to the correct floor, is about to go in the called direction, and opens the doors.

Lifts do not respond immediately or do everything at once. To simplify handling time in this exercise, the provided Lift class has a 'tick' method. Every time you call it, the lift should perform an action. An action could be something like moving to another floor or opening the doors.

Another simplification is that Lifts only accept new calls and requests _between_ calls to 'tick', not _during_. (Then we don't have to model what happens between floors or accept new input in the middle of a call to 'tick').

The starting code has a Lift class with basic attributes like a floor, requests and doors. Can you build on this code and create something that fulfills all the desired features? Consider Object-Oriented design principles. Can you make Lift into a well encapsulated class that does not need to be told what to do by another object? 

### Multiple lifts
When you have a single lift working well, you may want to tackle these further features: 

- there can be more than one lift.
- only one lift needs to respond to each call.
- on each floor there is a monitor above each lift door. While the lift is moving it shows which floor it is on.
- when the lift stops at a floor to answer a call, the monitor shows which direction it will go in.
- when fulfilling a call, the relevant lift makes a 'DING' as it opens the doors.

Note: the printer does not currently show the lift monitor and the ding.
